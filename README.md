# Live-Digital-Traffic-Management-System
This project provides a complete real-time traffic management system that predicts congestion using machine learning, visualizes live traffic flow, and assists city/roadway authorities in decision-making. It integrates feature engineering, a trained Isolation Forest model, and a modern dashboard for visualization.
